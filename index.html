    <p> My favorite hobby is swimming, although I haven't been able to do much of it in the past year or so. Swimming is a sport that you can have fun doing and still get exercise. In summer it cools you down and sometimes there are slides or rides you can go on. Most importantly, it's for all ages! That means that if your over 1 and have an adult, you can go swimming!</p>
